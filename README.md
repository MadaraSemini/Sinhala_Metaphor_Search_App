# Sinhala_Metaphor_Search_App
In this project, the goal is to construct a Sinhala Metaphor Corpus containing 100+ poems with annotated metaphors. Additionally, attributes like author, year, and domain will be added. The project involves developing a user-friendly search application, primarily serving poets and researchers as a valuable resource for Sinhala metaphors and poems.
